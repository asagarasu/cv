# **A Time to Scatter Stones and a Time to Gather Stones Together**

1. Preface

In Lawrence Block’s *Eight Million Ways to Die*, Chance, an African-American character, shares a visceral bond with a mask from his homeland, describing it not merely as an artifact but as “the real thing.” This mask, for him, is a bridge to ancestral memory, embodying one of the most extreme possibilities of temporal generation of thingness. “The very first piece I bought, I still have it. It’s hanging in the bedroom. A Dan mask. Poro Society. I didn’t know shit about African art but I responded to the mask’s artistic integrity. […] What happened was I looked at that piece of smooth black wood and I was looking in a mirror. I saw myself, I saw my father, I was looking back through the damned ages. You know what I’m talking about?” It was this passage—alongside William Faulkner’s use of the clock in *The Sound and the Fury* as a haunting reminder of time’s relentless pull, and Maupassant’s portrayal of furniture animated with eerie life—that pushed me, as a literature undergraduate, to question the silent power of things as an agency *creating* our sensible world in philosophy.

Philosophy has long grappled with the nature of beings and their relational structures. Since Socrates, human subjectivity—often conceived as the soul—was traditionally viewed as an immutable, absolute entity. However, as subjectivity is increasingly considered as finite and contingent, new questions arise regarding its relationship to thinghood. This shift challenges the dimensions of substance that resist reduction to mere cognition, as well as the often-overlooked internal relations between things, which are rooted in their form and purpose (telos). I argue that these interrelations, reflecting the tension between potentiality and actuality, remain insufficiently explored in contemporary discourse.

My research addresses this gap by systematically defining ontological relationships within the phenomenological tradition. It specifically examines the recursive interactions through which beings—both human and non-human—mutually shape and redefine their realities. More broadly, I investigate the impact of these processes on the constitution of historical existence and its temporal dynamics. Art and aesthetics play a central role in this work, as they often encapsulate and condense these processes into concentrated, evocative forms. My current studies on artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, extends this trajectory by examining how computational systems similarly distill and reflect historical existence—this time through algorithmic means.

2. Model
   
While I do not primarily identify as an analytic philosopher, I will employ a series of formal models to elucidate the framework I have developed throughout my graduate career. This framework offers a non-linear model that maps the intertwining and evolution of beings within their ontological landscapes, introducing new concepts such as metaontic awareness, aesthetic ontogenesis, and cycling worldliness.

In the model, time is structured following Martin Heidegger as ecstatic temporality, where past, future, and present are interdependently layered. The past (P) persists as thrownness, providing the ontological backdrop that informs and limits future possibilities. The future (F) unfolds as a horizon of anticipated possibilities, which only become actualized in the present (A) through the act of reversal. The present emerges as a dynamic synthesis of what has been and what is to come:

$$
P_i(\tau) \otimes F_i(\tau) \rightarrow A_i(\tau)
$$

Every moment participates in the ongoing construction of meaning. In the totality of significances, the thing acts as a nodal point. Unlike an object, which is a cognitive representation of a thing, the thing in its lived encounters is an evolving time-space. Each encounter leaves traces that reshape its ontic content as preserved in logos (in Heidegger's words, the gathering gatheredness), even when the thing is only recalled, dreamed of, imagined, or hinted as the absent.

$$
\nabla Th(Φ)
$$

It is noteworthy that encounters with Φ can emerge as purely embodied interactions, that is, skilled actions that do not require conscious deliberation or reflection. Essentially, they unfold in sensible forms, which exist as pre-understood backgrounds of meaning, forming the basis for further interpretation and engagement without needing explicit conceptualization. This thinging process is inherently historicizing, as encounters draw forward Φ’s preimage—the sedimented layers of prior meaning-making—and reconfigure it into a postimage, projecting new possibilities. Many of these possibilities remain latent, yet each potential glimpsed within the encounter becomes an immanent part of Φ’s being in that instance. This creates a labyrinthine structure, where Φ embodies not only what it has been and what it currently is but also what it might have been or could still become. At any spatiotemporal juncture, Φ serves as both an opening and a closure. At this point, Φ’s nonradiant appearance (φαίνεσθαι) arises from its self-concealment, which marks the limits of sensibility:

$$
\phi_{\text{non}}(t) = \lim_{t \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( P_i(t) \cdot A_i(t) \cdot \nabla F_i(t) \right)
$$

This formula represents how time-spaces of indeterminacy accumulate, creating a sort of uncanny presence that simultaneously reveals and withholds the transcendent.

In the meantime, when we use the thing in its equipmentality, the wear and decay of it confirm the threshold of its temporality and express a deeper existential truth about finitude. This leads to an ontological disclosure of worldliness:

$$
Eq(Φ) = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \nabla Th(Φ) \, dt
$$

Then, metaontic awareness is triggered when the interplay of thinging, equipmentality, and nonradiant appearance allows the individual temporality to glimpse its own finitude through Φ's ontological disclosure:

$$
MA = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{Φ \in T} Eq(Φ) \times \phi_{\text{non}}(t)
$$

Metaontic awareness is the notion I define as the perceptual transition where conceptual understanding yields to aesthetic attunement as well as its disruption. This transition happens when meaning is no longer sensed as constrained by cognitive categories but as Φ’s self-authorizing presence that is always retreating. This awareness occurs precisely at the boundary where composed homogeneity, which describes how things appear within temporal-spatial contexts as structured givenness (following Kant: though this appearance is a posteriori, it relies on transcendental temporal conditions that render things intelligible), manifests in a way that elevates the subject into an existential standing-over-against with the occurrence of being by depriving it of its subjectivity, hinting at the divine. Fundamentally, this alignment preserves the freedom of thinging and reflects its dual nature: as Heidegger writes in "The Thing," it contains mortality as part of its structure, stating that “as the shrine of Nothing, death harbors within itself the presencing of Being.” It is also a recursive structure that unfolds through repeated encounters between human beings and things.

Aesthetic ontogenesis is subsequently introduced as the process by which the perceptual essence of things continually evolves. This evolution is intrinsically rooted in the concept of void, signifying the structural absence driving each perceptual schema, which provides the condition of openness that allows Φ to undergo infinite replacement of its manifestations, leading to the splendor of aesthetic diversity.

$$
AO_{world} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{\Phi \in T} \left( \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \nabla Th(\Phi) \, dt \times \phi_{\text{non}}(t) \right) \otimes V_{\text{void}}
$$

At the core of this model is the idea that the void, vno longer an absence but a presence so full, so weighty, so dense with all that might have been and never will be, is the source of magnificence in perception, as it holds within it the tangled roots of a million forgotten things, memories of what was and what could never be, reborn again and again in the light of each new moment’s seeing. When the prisoner steps out of the cave, when he steps into the sun that blinds and scorches, it is a step into the raw, aching throb of what it means to see and not understand, to be seized by the world’s hard, blinding, uncaring beauty. Therefore, it is in this moment, in the silence between cognition and meaning, where everything stands naked and true, that love emerges. Love then is not the reaching for the light but the being broken by it, the knowing that to stand there in its glare, unable to hide, is all that we can do—in surrender to presence.

3. Progress

In my Ph.D. dissertation, "Heidegger’s *polemos*: An Aesthetic Inquiry," I establish the theoretical foundation of my model by providing an in-depth exegesis of Heidegger’s mid-to-late philosophy, particularly his concept of *polemos* (strife). Through an analysis of art as the rift-design between World and Earth, I clarify how things mediate the relationship between humanity and the sacred within a modern context of divine absence, with freedom as their ultimate telos. Within Heidegger’s frameworks of *Being-in-the-world* and *the Fourfold*, I elucidate how things gather meaning and embody authenticity by carrying the temporal and finite nature of existence. The existential conflict embedded in things, as articulated through poiesis since the inception of words, enables humans to confront their own finitude, framing an integrated model where art, existence, truth, and beauty converge. I extend *polemos* through *logos* as an interpretative structure, showing that *logos*, as the struggle to reveal phenomena in their withdrawal, encompasses a variety of expressions—literary, religious, and technological. This interpretative framework suggests that *logos* can potentially reconnect with the divine, offering new ways to comprehend Being within contemporary life.

The relationship within this model can be represented by the following formula:

$$
Th_{polemos} = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \nabla_{existentiality}(Φ) \times Eq(\Phi) \otimes \phi_{\text{non}}(t) \rightarrow MA \quad \text{and} \quad AO
$$

In this equation, $Th_{polemos}$ represents the function of things within *polemos*, grounded in the interaction of existential conflict ($\nabla_{existentiality}(Φ)$), equipmental utility ($Eq(\Phi)$), and non-radiant appearance ($\phi_{\text{non}}(t)$). This groundwork supports the emergence of *metaontic awareness* (MA) and *aesthetic ontogenesis* (AO), positioning things as phenomenological carriers of the essential link between humanity and Being.
