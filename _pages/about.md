I consider myself a scholarly writer. With a Ph.D. in philosophy and education, I perceive academia as a distinct form of intellectual art. My tools are diverse: the structured beauty of alphabets, the crispness of logic, and the illuminating theories I’ve gleaned from a myriad of thinkers. Together with the rich tapestry of everyday life, these components have sculpted the narrative of my doctoral dissertation and various journal articles.

My core curiosity revolves around understanding how the aesthetic facets of human existence can enrich us toward, to echo Socrates, an examined life of virtue and the audacity to confront death. In particular, I am continually fascinated by the concept of <i>thinging</i>, its ties to the sacred, the mystical, and the esoteric, and its recurring presence in both literary expressions and ordinary discourse. This includes reflections on the spatio-temporal finiteness of being, and how such reflections reverberate in our worldly interactions in the spiritual, affective, and material spheres, manifesting as various forms of enchantment within the metamorphosis of phenomena. In today’s era, dominated by capitalistic pursuits and technological overlays, I find it imperative to revisit these possibly overlooked referential chains.

Yet, my love of words is not limited to the academic. I indulge in creative writing, crafting short stories in Mandarin and English, some of which have been published. It’s my alternative, more intimate canvas, where ideas are painted not only with intellect but also with <i>eros</i> and imagination.
