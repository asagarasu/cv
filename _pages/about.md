I often refer to myself as a scholarly writer. As someone with a Ph.D. in <a href='#'>philosophy and education</a>, the realm of academia is, for me, an intellectual artistry in its own right. My tools are diverse: the structured beauty of alphabets, the crispness of logic, and the illuminating theories I’ve gleaned from a myriad of thinkers. These elements, combined with the vastness of ordinary human expression, shape the narrative of my dissertation and various journal articles.

My core curiosity revolves around understanding how the <a href='#'>aesthetic facets of human existence</a> can enrich us toward, to echo Socrates, an examined life of virtue and the audacity to confront death. In particular, I am continually fascinated by the concept of <a href='#'><i>thinging</i></a>, its relationship to the sacred, magic, and the esoteric, as well as its cyclical presence in our articulations. This includes reflections on the finiteness of human life, and how such reflections reverberate in man’s worldly interactions in both the spiritual and material spheres, manifesting as various forms of <a href='#'>enchantment</a> within the metamorphosis of phenomena. In today’s era, dominated by capitalistic pursuits and technological overlays, I find it imperative to revisit these possibly overlooked referential chains.

Yet, my love of words is not limited to the academic. I indulge in creative writing, crafting short stories in Mandarin and English, some of which have been published. It’s my alternative, more intimate canvas, where ideas are painted not only with intellect but also with <i>eros</i> and imagination.
