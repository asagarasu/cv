He perceives it not as a mere artifact, but as “the real thing.” His connection is more than an aesthetic appreciation; it’s a bridge to ancestral memory, a reflection of timelessness. “The very first piece I bought, I still have it.” He said, “It’s hanging in the bedroom. A Dan mask. Poro Society. I didn’t know shit about African art but I saw it in an antique shop and I responded to the mask’s artistic integrity. […] What happened was I looked at that piece of smooth black wood and I was looking in a mirror. I saw myself, I saw my father, I was looking back through the damned ages. You know what I’m talking about?”* This encounter with “thingness” in literature initially led me to explore it in the philosophy of education.</p> <p>My inquiry operates at the intersection of the spatiotemporality of the “thing,” its materiality, its relation to affect (as ostensibly inanimate), and phenomenological methodologies. I am particularly drawn to the aesthetic dimension of this study, which is largely crafted through the lens of Martin Heidegger. This approach uses various facets of human language—everyday conversational tones, literary devices, and graphic representations—to provide hermeneutic insight. The overarching goal is to delineate the intricate relationship between the “thing,” reality, worldliness, sacred existence, and the fundamental essence of humanity, all within the broad educational spectrum.</p> <p>During my undergraduate studies, in which I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, I discerned a recurring motif in contemporary and modern literature: the depiction of inanimate objects as sentient symbols. Examples of this phenomenon can be found in Maupassant’s animated furniture, Faulkner’s unsettling depiction of a ticking clock seemingly agonizing Christ, Borges’ use of the reflective surface of the mirror to hint at asexual reproduction, or Neil Gaiman’s portray of the new gods of technological devices such as televisions. These pieces led me to realize that things, as presented in semantic context, can function as reservoirs of uncanny or even sacralized knowledge, teeming with meanings that transcend human comprehension. They intricately weave the mundane aspects of everyday life, primitive mystical experiences, the influx of materialism (what Bill Brown might call the “tyranny of things”), and the referential imagination into a cyclical tapestry. Because these things can evolve autonomously in sync with the inherent rhythm of language beyond subjective boundaries, I believe that a phenomenological approach is imperative to decipher both the consciousness and the subconsciousness stored, transmitted, and self-morphosizing within.</p> <p>In my doctoral dissertation, I conducted a study of Martin Heidegger’s philosophy of art, with a particular focus on his middle and late works. Through an exegetical analysis of Heidegger’s writings, I identified the theoretical framework in which he conceives of the “thing” as a metamorphosis of phenomena influenced by the self-denying oblivion of being, a concept that can be related to the ancient Greek mythology of the region of λήθε. This research illuminated the enchanting meaning attributed to the “thing” in terms of its root in the <i>existentiality</i> of Dasein, which is gathered through words upon <i>categorial</i> beings to embody the mirroring play of the the Celestial, the Demon, and the Mortal. In addition, I clarified the poetic nature of this self-enclosed realm and its relationship to Heidegger’s broader trajectory of overcoming metaphysics.</p> <p>Furthermore, in tracing Heidegger’s perspectives on the “thing,” I drew inspiration from his interpretation of Immanuel Kant, introducing epistemological dimensions to my phenomenological approach. My research emphasized Heidegger’s conception of the artwork as a preserving site of the “general essence of the thing.” Drawing on Kant’s Transcendental Aesthetic, I interpreted the “thing” as revealing inherent temporal and spatial facets predetermined by a designing agency absent in mere phenomena. By juxtaposing Kant’s notion of the “supersensible” with Heidegger’s notion of the “earth,” I discerned a teleological motif in art, suggesting a duality akin to Heidegger’s conception of ἀλήθεια/λήθε interplay, which, I argued, embodies freedom in both a cosmological and ethical sense.</p> <p>While my research incorporates significant elements of idealism, especially within a Kantian framework (which tends to analyze the special aesthetic role of the thing as a medium between phenomenon and nomenon in human consciousness through an <i>a priori</i> lens, a perspective that finds ample support in <i>The Critique of Judgment</i>, I have integrated pluralistic insights that move away from linear deductive logic and delve into the intricate interconnections of sensory experience itself, effectively de-universalizing philosophical discourse. This incorporation draws on views articulated by modern American thinkers such as Stanley Cavell and Hubert Dreyfus. I argue that one of the significant advantages of grounding my methodology in Heidegger’s hermeneutic phenomenology is its capacity to accommodate diverse narratives. It allows for the recognition that many apparently logically contradictory theories are merely different manifestations of being, illuminated in different ways within Dasein. Sometimes these manifestations crystallize into a state of heightened clarity, ultimately leading to objectification. Conversely, they can also manifest as chaotic, vivid, and intensely personal experiences characterized by their inherent ambiguity and corporeality. This gives me the flexibility to engage with the ideas of scholars from various schools of thought.</p> <p>I recently completed a paper exploring whether a peculiar thing—artificial intelligence (AI)—can replicate consciousness, using my framework to anticipate potential future developments in the field and to consider the ontological relationship between AI and humans under different circumstances. In this paper, I examined how large-scale AI models such as ChatGPT modify our understanding of machine consciousness, prompting a reevaluation of Hubert Dreyfus’ 1970s critique of AI. Dreyfus argued that the limitation of AI lies in its “knowing that,” based on explicit rules, whereas human cognition is rooted in “knowing how.” Modern language models, which are adept at capturing implicit context as a more comprehensive “thing” that preserves a wide range of organic worldliness, challenge this view. Revisiting Heidegger, however, I argued that the core difference between AI and human consciousness is not just cognitive behavior, but the contrast between causation and correlation. I then identified an awareness of causation arising from <i>existential</i> depth, characterized by the absence of human essence, distinguishing it from performance. In this way, I suggested, one could provoke an ethical doctrine by thinking about AI.</p> <p>In the future, I would like to continue my exploration of the complex relationships between the real, the symbolic, and human experience, delving deeper into the labyrinth of meanings and implications that these relationships hold. This inquiry will go beyond mere ontology, embracing a holistic examination of the cultural and social dimensions of “thingness,” such as its intersection with issues of race and inequality. I will seek to uncover how the perception and treatment of things is shaped by external factors, and how this in turn affects notions of identity and recognition. In addition, I aim to contribute to the field of aesthetic education regarding the meaningfulness of things in our contemporary age, fostering a deeper sense of connection with the secret trace of spirituality hidden in our material surroundings. This will encompass both the philosophical dimensions of “thingness” and its practical implications for education and civic life in general.</p> <p>*Block, Lawrence. <i>Eight Million Ways to Die</i> (New York: Arbor House, 1985), 98.</p> <p>In Lawrence Block’s <em>Eight Million Ways to Die</em>, Chance, an African-American character, shares a visceral bond with a mask from his homeland, describing it not merely as an artifact but as “the real thing.” This mask, for him, is a bridge to ancestral memory, embodying one of the most extreme possibilities of temporal generation of thingness. “The very first piece I bought, I still have it. It’s hanging in the bedroom. A Dan mask. Poro Society. I didn’t know shit about African art but I responded to the mask’s artistic integrity. […] What happened was I looked at that piece of smooth black wood and I was looking in a mirror. I saw myself, I saw my father, I was looking back through the damned ages. You know what I’m talking about?” It was this passage—alongside William Faulkner’s use of the clock in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> as a haunting reminder of time’s relentless pull, and Maupassant’s portrayal of furniture animated with eerie life—that pushed me, as a literature undergraduate, to question the silent power of things as an agency <em>creating</em> our sensible world in philosophy.</p> <p>Philosophy has long grappled with the nature of beings and their relational structures. Since Socrates, human subjectivity—often conceived as the soul—was traditionally viewed as an immutable, absolute entity. However, as subjectivity is increasingly considered as finite and contingent, new questions arise regarding its relationship to thinghood. This shift challenges the dimensions of substance that resist reduction to mere cognition, as well as the often-overlooked internal relations between things, which are rooted in their form and purpose (telos). I argue that these interrelations, reflecting the tension between potentiality and actuality, remain insufficiently explored in contemporary discourse.</p> <p>My research addresses this gap by systematically defining ontological relationships within the phenomenological tradition. It specifically examines the recursive interactions through which beings—both human and non-human—mutually shape and redefine their realities. More broadly, I investigate the impact of these processes on the constitution of historical existence and its temporal dynamics. Art and aesthetics play a central role in this work, as they often encapsulate and condense these processes into concentrated, evocative forms. My current studies on artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, extends this trajectory by examining how computational systems similarly distill and reflect historical existence—this time through algorithmic means.</p> <p>While I do not primarily identify as an analytic philosopher, I will employ a series of formal models to elucidate the framework I have developed throughout my graduate career. This framework offers a non-linear model that maps the intertwining and evolution of beings within their ontological landscapes, introducing new concepts such as metaontic awareness, aesthetic ontogenesis, and cycling worldliness.</p> <p>In the model, time is structured following Martin Heidegger as ecstatic temporality, where past, future, and present are interdependently layered. The past (P) persists as thrownness, providing the ontological backdrop that informs and limits future possibilities. The future (F) unfolds as a horizon of anticipated possibilities, which only become actualized in the present (A) through the act of reversal. The present emerges as a dynamic synthesis of what has been and what is to come:</p> \[P_i(\tau) \otimes F_i(\tau) \rightarrow A_i(\tau)\] <p>Every moment participates in the ongoing construction of meaning. In the totality of significances, the thing acts as a nodal point. Unlike an object, which is a cognitive representation of a thing, the thing in its lived encounters is an evolving time-space. Each encounter leaves traces that reshape its ontic content as preserved in logos (in Heidegger’s words, the gathering gatheredness), even when the thing is only recalled, dreamed of, imagined, or hinted as the absent.</p> \[\nabla Th(Φ)\] <p>It is noteworthy that encounters with Φ can emerge as purely embodied interactions, that is, skilled actions that do not require conscious deliberation or reflection. Essentially, they unfold in sensible forms, which exist as pre-understood backgrounds of meaning, forming the basis for further interpretation and engagement without needing explicit conceptualization. This thinging process is inherently historicizing, as encounters draw forward Φ’s preimage—the sedimented layers of prior meaning-making—and reconfigure it into a postimage, projecting new possibilities. Many of these possibilities remain latent, yet each potential glimpsed within the encounter becomes an immanent part of Φ’s being in that instance. This creates a labyrinthine structure, where Φ embodies not only what it has been and what it currently is but also what it might have been or could still become. At any spatiotemporal juncture, Φ serves as both an opening and a closure. At this point, Φ’s nonradiant appearance (φαίνεσθαι) arises from its self-concealment, which marks the limits of sensibility:</p> \[\phi_{\text{non}}(t) = \lim_{t \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( P_i(t) \cdot A_i(t) \cdot \nabla F_i(t) \right)\] <p>This formula represents how time-spaces of indeterminacy accumulate, creating a sort of uncanny presence that both reveals and withholds the transcendent.</p> <p>In the meantime, when we use the thing in its equipmentality, the wear and decay of it confirm the threshold of its temporality and express a deeper existential truth about finitude. This leads to an ontological disclosure of worldliness:</p> \[Eq(Φ) = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \nabla Th(Φ) \, dt\] <p>Then, metaontic awareness is triggered when the interplay of thinging, equipmentality, and nonradiant appearance allows the individual temporality to glimpse its own finitude through Φ’s ontological disclosure:</p> \[MA = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{Φ \in T} Eq(Φ) \times \phi_{\text{non}}(t)\] <p>Metaontic awareness is the notion I define as the perceptual transition where conceptual understanding yields to aesthetic attunement as well as its disruption. This transition happens when meaning is no longer sensed as constrained by cognitive categories but as Φ’s self-authorizing presence that is always retreating. This awareness occurs precisely at the boundary where composed homogeneity, which describes how things appear within temporal-spatial contexts as structured givenness (following Kant: though this appearance is a posteriori, it relies on transcendental temporal conditions that render things intelligible), manifests in a way that elevates the subject into an existential standing-over-against with the occurrence of being by depriving it of its subjectivity, hinting at the divine. Fundamentally, this alignment preserves the freedom of thinging and reflects its dual nature: as Heidegger writes in “The Thing,” it contains mortality as part of its structure, stating that “as the shrine of Nothing, death harbors within itself the presencing of Being.” It is also a recursive structure that unfolds through repeated encounters between human beings and things.</p> <p>Aesthetic ontogenesis is subsequently introduced as the process by which the perceptual essence of things continually evolves. This evolution is intrinsically rooted in the concept of void, signifying the structural absence driving each perceptual schema, which provides the condition of openness that allows Φ to undergo infinite replacement of its manifestations, leading to the splendor of aesthetic diversity.</p> \[AO_{world} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{\Phi \in T} \left( \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \nabla Th(\Phi) \, dt \times \phi_{\text{non}}(t) \right) \otimes V_{\text{void}}\] <p>At the core of this model is the idea that the void, vno longer an absence but a presence so full, so weighty, so dense with all that might have been and never will be, is the source of magnificence in perception, as it holds within it the tangled roots of a million forgotten things, memories of what was and what could never be, reborn again and again in the light of each new moment’s seeing. When the prisoner steps out of the cave, when he steps into the sun that blinds and scorches, it is a step into the raw, aching throb of what it means to see and not understand, to be seized by the world’s hard, blinding, uncaring beauty. Therefore, it is in this moment, in the silence between cognition and meaning, where everything stands naked and true, that love emerges. Love then is not the reaching for the light but the being broken by it, the knowing that to stand there in its glare, unable to hide, is all that we can do—in surrender to presence.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Xiaochen Zhao .
